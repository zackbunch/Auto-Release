# SYAC - Saved You A Click

SYAC is a GitLab-native build automation tool written in Go. It streamlines the container build and promotion process for microservices deployed via GitLab CI/CD, targeting OpenShift environments.

---

## What It Does

- Reads from GitLab CI environment variables and a `.env` file for local testing.
- Builds and tags Docker images based on:
  - **Feature branches** â†’ uses `CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA`
  - **Merge requests into `dev`** â†’ creates **Release Candidate (RC)** tags like `rc.42`
- Pushes images based on derived logic (e.g. skips push for dev unless `SYAC_FORCE_PUSH=true`).
- Supports configuration via environment variables with sane defaults.

## Future Enhancements

- **Automatic Semantic Version Bumping**  
  Analyze Merge Request comments for version bump hints:
  - `#patch`, `#minor`, or `#major`
  - Apply bump logic accordingly (e.g., 1.2.3 â†’ 1.2.4, 1.3.0, or 2.0.0)

- **Changelog Generation**  
  Generate/update changelogs as part of the tagging process.

- **Multi-registry Promotion**  
  Add support for registry path rewriting or cross-registry mirroring for different environments.

- **Dry Run Support**  
  Add a mode that prints actions without executing them, useful for debugging or verification.
